The benefits of online shopping are encouraging more and more people to experience it every day and change their usual shopping patterns. After some time, online shopping has become more synchronized with the speed of modern life and has been able to align itself with the moods and growing needs of customers. While the daily busyness has reduced the opportunity to enjoy leisure time, spending long periods of time to make inner-city trips and buy daily needs loses its meaning. What is prioritized for people in their free time is recreation, education, sports, enjoying personal interests and relieving daily fatigue.",
